## Purpose

This repository contains data used by Webb et al. for the manuscript "Size distribution of mineral dust emissions from sparsely vegetated and supply-limited dryland soils" submitted for publication in Geophysical Research Letters.

## Data

Measurements were collected during 10 dust emission events in March to May of 2017 and 2018 at three sites on the Jornada Experimental Range in south-central New Mexico, USA. The study sites were named Site 3 (playa), Site 4 (mixed bunchgrasses and forbs) and Site 5 (open shrublands), as described by Webb et al. (2016). 

Meteorological data were measured with centrally-located meteorological towers equipped with RM Young 3101 cup anemometers at heights of 0.7 m, 1.4 m and 2.4 m above ground level, and one RM Young 3002 anemometer and wind vane at 4.8 m height. Temperature sensors (Campbell Scientific 107-L) were mounted at 2.0 m and 4.0 m heights. Data were sampled at 1 Hz and were logged every 1 min on Campbell Scientific CR1000 data loggers. 

Dust concentrations were measured using a pair of optical particle sizer (OPS) spectrometers (TSI model 3330) mounted on a mast at 1.25 m and 2.5 m heights adjacent to the meteorological tower. The spectrometers were configured to measure count size distributions and reported concentrations for particles in 12 bins with diameters 0.3-0.5, 0.5-0.7, 0.7-1.0, 1.0-1.5, 1.5-2.0, 2.0-2.5, 2.5-3.0, 3.0-4.0, 4.0-5.0, 5.0-6.0, 6.0-8.0, 8.0-10.0 Î¼m. 

Horizontal sediment mass flux was measured using five Modified Wilson and Cooke (MWAC) sediment samplers with inlet 2.34 x 10-4 m2 (Webb et al., 2019). Five freely rotating masts, each with four MWAC samplers (0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.85 m above ground level) were located surrounding the meteorological towers. 

Transect data were collected on three parallel 50 m transects spaced 25 m apart with the central transect passing through the center of the fenced areas. On the morning of each dust event, methods of Herrick et al. (2018) were used to measure vegetation height, the size distribution of canopy gaps >=5 cm (unvegetated spaces between plant canopies), and foliar cover of vegetation by species and soil surface properties.

Data files include:

2. OPS_Spectrometer_Data - This folder contains raw TSI Optical Particle Sizer (OPS) spectrometer data for each measured event from instruments mounted at 1.25 m and 2.5m above ground level.
3. 2017-2018 FINAL DIMA 5.3b as of 2018-10-23.mdb - This file is a MS Access database containing vegetation transect data collected for each measured dust event.
4. Event_MWAC_Data_2017_2018.xlsx - This file contains raw Modified Wilson and Cooke (MWAC) sediment sampler data for each measured dust event.

The following lists provide field definitions for the MWAC data and meteorological data.
